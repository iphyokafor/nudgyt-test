# Nudgyt-test

The goal is to create a Server application with Nest.js written in TypeScript with the following requirement :

- The application can start with only two commands: 

  ```bash
  npm install
  ``` 
  and 
  
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

- The application has a system of authentication. I need to be able to register and I need
to be able to log in.

- The application has a call allowing a registered user only to see all the users created.


## API Endpoints

The API provides the following features or endpoints:


  ```bash
   Register a user

   Login user

   Fetch all users

   Update a user
   ```
